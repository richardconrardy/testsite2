If you don’t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following great documentation for beginners.\nHugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u003cnew_project\u003e The Relearn theme provides archetypes to help you create this kind of pages.\nFrontmatter Configuration Each Hugo page has to define a frontmatter in toml, yaml or json. This site will use toml in all cases.\nThe Relearn theme uses the following parameters on top of Hugo ones:\n+++ # Table of contents (toc) is enabled by default. Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = false # If set, this will be used for the page's menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \"\" # If set, this will explicitly override common rules for the expand state of a page's menu entry alwaysopen = true # If set, this will explicitly override common rules for the sorting order of a page's submenu entries ordersectionsby = \"title\" # The title of the page heading will be prefixed by this HTML content headingPre = \"\" # The title of the page heading will be postfixed by this HTML content headingPost = \"\" # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content menuPre = \"\" # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content menuPost = \"\" # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \"\" # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \"\" +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a menuPre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the GitHub icon.\n+++ title = \"GitHub repo\" menuPre = \"\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e \" +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \"My page\" weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, the Relearn theme will use a page’s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page’s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We’ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \"Install on Linux\" menuTitle = \"Linux\" +++ Override expand state rules for menu entries You can change how the theme expands menu entries on the side of the content with the alwaysopen setting on a per page basis. If alwaysopen=false for any given entry, its children will not be shown in the menu as long as it is not necessary for the sake of navigation.\nThe theme generates the menu based on the following rules:\nall parent entries of the active page including their siblings are shown regardless of any settings immediate children entries of the active page are shown regardless of any settings if not overridden, all other first level entries behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=false if not overridden, all other entries of levels besides the first behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=true all visible entries show their immediate children entries if alwaysopen=true; this proceeds recursively all remaining entries are not shown You can see this feature in action on the example page for children shortcode and its children pages.\n",

    "content": "Using the command: hugo new [relative new content path], you can start a content file with the date and title automatically set. While this is a welcome feature, active writers need more: archetypes. These are preconfigured skeleton pages with default frontmatter.\nThe Relearn theme defines some few archetypes of pages but you are free to define new ones to your liking. All can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being the layout of the content.\nPredefined Archetypes Home A Home page is the starting page of your project. It’s best to have only one page of this kind in your project.\nTo create a home page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind home _index.md This leads to a file with the following content\n+++ archetype = \"home\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" +++ Lorem Ipsum. Chapter A Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found below it.\nTo create a chapter page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind chapter \u003cname\u003e/_index.md This leads to a file with the following content\n+++ archetype = \"chapter\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" weight = X +++ Lorem Ipsum. Replace the X with a number. Because this number will be used to generate the subtitle of the chapter page, set the number to a consecutive value starting at 1 for each new chapter level.\nDefault A Default page is any other content page. If you set an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, this archetype will be used to generate the page.\nTo create a default page, run either one of the following commands\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e/_index.md or\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e.md This leads to a file with the following content\n+++ title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" weight = X +++ Lorem Ipsum. Replace the X with a number or delete the whole weight parameter entirely.\nSelf defined Archetypes If you are in need of further archetypes you can define your own or even redefine existing ones.\nTemplate Define a template file in your project at archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.md and make sure it has at least the frontmatter parameter for that archetype like\n+++ archetype = \"\u003ckind\u003e\" +++ Afterwards you can generate new content files of that kind with the following command\nhugo new --kind \u003ckind\u003e \u003cname\u003e/_index.md Partials To define how your archetypes are rendered, define corresponding partial files in your projects directory layouts/partials/archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.\nIf you use an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, the default archetype will be used to generate the page.\nRelated to each archetype, several hook partial files in the form of \u003chook\u003e.html can be given inside each archetype directory. If a partial for a specific hook is missing, no output is generated for this hook.\nThe following hooks are used:\nName Notes styleclass Defines a set of CSS classes to be added to the HTML’s \u003cmain\u003e element. You can use these classes to define own CSS rules in your custom-header.html article Defines the HTML how to render your content Take a look at the existing archetypes of this theme to get an idea how to utilize it.\nOutput formats Each hook file can be overridden of a specific output format. Eg. if you define a new output format PLAINTEXT in your config.toml, you can add a file layouts/partials/archetypes/default.plaintext.html to change the way how normal content is written for that output format.\n",

For a detailed list of changes, see the history page.\n0.95.0 The minimum required Hugo version.\nBreaking A change that requires action by you after upgrading to assure the site is still functional.\nChange A change in default behavior that may requires action by you if you want to revert it.\nNew Marks new behavior you might find interesting or comes configurable.\n5.12.0 (2023-03-03) Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed (again). While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew Support for the great VSCode Front Matter extension which provides on-premise CMS capabilties to Hugo.\nThe theme provides Front Matter snippets for its shortcodes. Currently only English and German is supported. Put a reference into your frontmatter.json like this\n{ ... \"frontMatter.extends\": [ \"./vscode-frontmatter/snippets.en.json\" ] ... } New Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic) is now complete and extended to the menu, the top navigation bar and print. You can experience this in the pirate translation. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew The scrollbars are now colored according to their variant color scheme to better fit into the visuals.\n5.11.0 (2023-02-07) Change The theme removed the popular jQuery library from its distribution.\nIn case you made changes to the theme that are dependend on this library you can place a copy of jQuery into your static/js directory and load it from your own layouts/partials/custom-header.html like this:\n\u003cscript src=\"{{\"js/jquery.min.js\"| relURL}}\" defer\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change Mermaid diagrams can now be configured for pan and zoom on site-, page-level or individually for each graph.\nThe default setting of on, in effect since 1.1.0, changed back to off as there was interference with scrolling on mobile and big pages.\nChange The theme is now capable to visually adapt to your OS’s light/dark mode setting.\nThis is also the new default setting if you haven’t configured themeVariant in your config.toml.\nAdditionally you can configure the variants to be taken for light/dark mode with the new themeVariantAuto parameter.\nThis is not supported for Internet Explorer 11, which still displays in the relearn-light variant.\nChange The JavaScript code for handling image lightboxes (provided by Featherlight) was replaced by a CSS-only solution.\nThis also changed the lightbox effects parameter from featherlight=false to lightbox=false. Nevertheless you don’t need to change anything as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the expand shortcode was changed. While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew Translation for Czech. This language is not supported for search.\nNew GitHub releases are also now tagged for the main version (eg. 1.2.x), major version (eg. 1.x) and the latest (just x) release making it easier for you to pin the theme to a certain version.\n5.10.0 (2023-01-25) New The attachments, badge, button and notice shortcodes have a new parameter color to set arbitrary CSS color values.\nAdditionally the --ACCENT-color brand color introduced in version 5.8.0 is now supported with these shortcodes.\n5.9.0 (2022-12-23) Change The required folder name for the attachments shortcode was changed for leaf bundles.\nPreviously, the attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups were required to be in a files subdirectory. For page bundles and leaf bundles in multilang setups they were always required to be in a _index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files or index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files subdirectory accordingly.\nThis added unnessessary complexity. So attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups can now also reside in a index.files directory. Although the old files directory is now deprecated, if both directories are present, only the old files directory will be used for compatiblity.\nChange Absolute links prefixed with http:// or https:// are now opened in a separate browser tab.\nYou can revert back to the old behavior by defining externalLinkTarget=\"_self\" in the params section of your config.toml.\nNew The theme now supports Hugo’s module system.\n5.8.0 (2022-12-08) New The new badge shortcode is now available to add highly configurable markers to your content as you can see it on this page.\nNew The new icon shortcode simplyfies the usage of icons. This can even be combined with also new badge shortcode.\nNew The theme now supports some of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) syntax and Hugo Markdown extensions, namely task lists, defintion lists and footnotes.\nNew A new color --ACCENT-color was introduced which is used for highlightning search results on the page. In case you simply don’t care, you don’t need to change anything in your variant stylesheet as the old yellow color is still used as default.\n5.7.0 (2022-11-29) Change The Korean language translation for this theme is now available with the language code ko. Formerly the country code kr was used instead.\nNew The button shortcode can now also be used as a real button inside of HTML forms - although this is a pretty rare use case. The documentation was updated accordingly.\nNew The search now supports the Korean language.\n5.6.0 (2022-11-18) New This release introduces an additional dedicated search page. On this page, displayed search results have more space making it easier scanning thru large number of results.\nTo activate this feature, you need to configure it in your config.toml as a new outputformat SEARCHPAGE for the home page. If you don’t configure it, no dedicated search page will be accessible and the theme works as before.\nYou can access the search page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or pressing enter inside of the search box.\nNew Keyboard handling for the TOC and search was improved.\nPressing CTRL+ALT+t now will not only toggle the TOC overlay but also places the focus to the first heading on opening. Subsequently this makes it possible to easily select headings by using the TAB key.\nThe search received its own brand new keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+f. This will focus the cursor inside of the the search box so you can immediately start your search by typing.\nNew You are now able to turn off the generation of generator meta tags in your HTML head to hide the used versions of Hugo and this theme.\nTo configure this in your config.toml make sure to set Hugo’s disableHugoGeneratorInject=true and also [params] disableGeneratorVersion=true, otherwise Hugo will generate a meta tag into your home page automagically.\nNew Creation of your project gets a little bit faster with this release.\nThis addresses increased build time with the 5.x releases. The theme now heavily caches partial results leading to improved performance. To further increase performance, unnecessary parts of the page are now skipped for creation of the print output (eg. menus, navigation bar, etc.).\n5.5.0 (2022-11-06) Change The way images are processed has changed. Now images are lazy loaded by default which speeds up page load on slow networks and/or big pages and also the print preview.\nFor that the JavaScript code to handle the lightbox and image effects on the client side was removed in favour for static generation of those effects on the server.\nIf you have used HTML directly in your Markdown files, this now has the downside that it doesn’t respect the effect query parameter anymore. In this case you have to migrate all your HTML img URLs manually to the respective HTML attributes.\nOld New \u003cimg src=\"pic.png?width=20vw\u0026classes=shadow,border\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"pic.png\" style=\"width:20vw;\" class=\"shadow border\"\u003e 5.4.0 (2022-11-01) Change With the proper settings in your config.toml your page is now servable from the local file system using file:// URLs.\nPlease note that the searchbox will only work for this if you reconfigure your outputformat for the homepage in your config.toml from JSON to SEARCH. The now deprecated JSON outputformat still works as before, so there is no need to reconfigure your installation if it is only served from http:// or https://.\nChange The button shortcode has a new parameter target to set the destination frame/window for the URL to open. If not given, it defaults to a new window/tab for external URLs or is not set at all for internal URLs. Previously even internal URLs where opened in a new window/tab.\nNew The math shortcode and mermaid shortcode now also support the align parameter if codefence syntax is used.\nNew Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic). This is only implemented for the content area but not the navigation sidebar. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew Translation for Finnish (Suomi).\n5.3.0 (2022-10-07) Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed. The functionality of the new implementation does not work with old browsers (Internet Explorer 11).\nNew Image formatting has two new classes to align images to the left or right. Additionally, the already existing inline option is now documented.\nNew Printing for the swagger shortcode was optimized to expand sections that are usually closed in interactive mode. This requires print support to be configured.\n5.2.0 (2022-08-03) Change If you’ve set collapsibleMenu = true in your config.toml, the menu will be expanded if a search term is found in a collapsed submenu. The menu will return to its initial collapse state once the search term does not match any submenus. 5.1.0 (2022-07-15) 0.95.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange Because the print preview URLs were non deterministic for normal pages in comparison to page bundles, this is now changed. Each print preview is now accessible by adding a index.print.html to the default URL.\nYou can revert this behavior by overwriting the PRINT output format setting in your config.tomlto:\n[outputFormats] [outputFormats.PRINT] name= \"PRINT\" baseName = \"index\" path = \"_print\" isHTML = true mediaType = 'text/html' permalinkable = false 5.0.0 (2022-07-05) Breaking The theme changed how JavaScript and CSS dependencies are loaded to provide a better performance. In case you’ve added own JavaScript code that depends on the themes jQuery implementation, you have to put it into a separate *.js file (if not already) and add the defer keyword to the script element. Eg.\n\u003cscript defer src=\"myscript.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change The way archetypes are used to generate output has changed. The new systems allows you, to redefine existing archetypes or even generate your own ones.\nYour existing markdown files will still work like before and therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade. Nevertheless, it is recommended to adapt your existing markdown files to the new way as follows:\nfor your home page, add the frontmatter parameter archetype = \"home\" and remove the leading heading\nfor all files containing the deprecated frontmatter parameter chapter = true, replace it with archetype = \"chapter\" and remove the leading headings\nChange The frontmatter options pre / post were renamed to menuPre / menuPost. The old options will still be used if the new options aren’t set. Therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade.\nNew Adding new partials heading-pre.html / heading-post.html and according frontmatter options headingPre / headingPost to modify the way your page`s main heading gets styled.\nNew The new shortcode math is available to add beautiful math and chemical formulae. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n4.2.0 (2022-06-23) Breaking The second parameter for the include shortcode was switched in meaning and was renamed from showfirstheading to hidefirstheading. If you haven’t used this parameter in your shortcode, the default behavior hasn’t changed and you don’t need to change anything.\nIf you’ve used the second boolean parameter, you have to rename it and invert its value to achieve the same behavior.\nChange Previously, if the tabs shortcode could not find a tab item because, the tabs ended up empty. Now the first tab is selected instead.\nChange The landingPageURL was removed from config.toml. You can safely remove this as well from your configuration as it is not used anymore. The theme will detect the landing page URL automatically.\nNew All shortcodes can now be also called from your partials. Examples for this are added to the documentation of each shortcode.\n4.1.0 (2022-06-12) New While fixing issues with the search functionality for non Latin languages, you can now configure to have multiple languages on a single page. 4.0.0 (2022-06-05) Breaking The custom_css config parameter was removed from the configuration. If used in an existing installation, it can be achieved by overriding the custom-header.html template in a much more generic manner.\nBreaking Because anchor hover color was not configurable without introducing more complexity to the variant stylesheets, we decided to remove --MAIN-ANCHOR-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the anchors now get their colors from --MAIN-LINK-color and --MAIN-ANCHOR-HOVER-color respectively.\nNew All shortcodes now support named parameter. The positional parameter are still supported but will not be enhanced with new features, so you don’t need to change anything in your installation.\nThis applies to expand, include, notice and siteparam.\nNew The button shortcode received some love and now has a parameter for the color style similar to other shortcodes.\nNew New colors --PRIMARY-color and --SECONDARY-color were added to provide easier modification of your custom style. Shortcodes with a color style can now have primary or secondary as additional values.\nThese two colors are the default for other, more specific color variables. You don’t need to change anything in your existing custom color stylesheets as those variables get reasonable default values.\nNew Translation for Polish. This language is not supported for search.\nNew The documentation for all shortcodes were revised.\n3.4.0 (2022-04-03) Breaking If you had previously overwritten the custom-footer.html partial to add visual elements below the content of your page, you have to move this content to the new partial content-footer.html. custom-footer.html was never meant to contain HTML other than additional styles and JavaScript.\nNew If you prefer expandable/collapsible menu items, you can now set collapsibleMenu=true in your config.toml. This will add arrows to all menu items that contain sub menus. The menu will expand/collapse without navigation if you click on an arrow.\nNew You can activate print support in your config.toml to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site.\nNew Translation for Traditional Chinese.\n3.3.0 (2022-03-28) New Introduction of new CSS variables to set the font. The theme distinguishes between --MAIN-font for all content text and --CODE-font for inline or block code. There are additional overrides for all headings. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for all available variables.\nNew The new shortcode swagger is available to include a UI for REST OpenAPI Specifications. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n3.2.0 (2022-03-19) 0.93.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange In this release the Mermaid JavaScript library will only be loaded on demand if the page contains a Mermaid shortcode or is using Mermaid codefences. This changes the behavior of disableMermaid config option as follows: If a Mermaid shortcode or codefence is found, the option will be ignored and Mermaid will be loaded regardlessly.\nThe option is still useful in case you are using scripting to set up your graph. In this case no shortcode or codefence is involved and the library is not loaded by default. In this case you can set disableMermaid=false in your frontmatter to force the library to be loaded. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for an example.\nNew Additional color variant variable --MERMAID-theme to set the variant’s Mermaid theme. This causes the Mermaid theme to switch with the color variant if it defers from the setting of the formerly selected color variant.\n3.1.0 (2022-03-15) New attachment and notice shortcodes have a new parameter to override the default icon. Allowed values are all Font Awesome 5 Free icons. 3.0.0 (2022-02-22) Breaking We made changes to the menu footer. If you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may have to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) in your partial. For a reference take a look into the menu-footer.html partial that is coming with the exampleSite.\nThis change was made to allow your own menu footer to be placed right after the so called prefooter that comes with the theme (containing the language switch and Clear history functionality).\nBreaking We have changed the default colors from the original Learn theme (the purple menu header) to the Relearn defaults (the light green menu header) as used in the official documentation.\nThis change will only affect your installation if you’ve not set the themeVariant parameter in your config.toml. If you still want to use the Learn color variant, you have to explicitly set themeVariant=\"learn\" in your config.toml.\nNote, that this will also affect your site if viewed with Internet Explorer 11 but in this case it can not be reconfigured as Internet Explorer does not support CSS variables.\nChange Due to a bug, that we couldn’t fix in a general manner for color variants, we decided to remove --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-ICONS-color and introduced --MENU-SEARCH-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange For consistency reasons, we renamed --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-color to --MENU-SEARCH-BORDER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew With this release you are now capable to define your own dark mode variants.\nTo make this possible, we have introduced a lot more color variables you can use in your color variants. Your old variants will still work and don’t need to be changed as appropriate fallback values are used by the theme. Nevertheless, the new colors allow for much more customization.\nTo see what’s now possible, see the new variants relearn-dark and neon that are coming with this release.\nNew To make the creation of new variants easier for you, we’ve added a new interactive theme variant generator. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\nNew You can now configure multiple color variants in your config.toml. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant switch will be shown in the menu footer. See the documentation for configuration.\nNote, that the new variant switch will not work with Internet Explorer 11 as it does not support CSS variables. Therefore, the variant switcher will not be displayed with Internet Explorer 11.\n2.9.0 (2021-11-19) Breaking This release removes the themes implementation of ref/relref in favor for Hugos standard implementation. This is because of inconsistencies with the themes implementation. In advantage, your project becomes standard compliant and exchanging this theme in your project to some other theme will be effortless.\nIn a standard compliant form you must not link to the *.md file but to its logical name. You’ll see, referencing other pages becomes much easier. All three types result in the same reference:\nType Non-Standard Standard Branch bundle basics/configuration/_index.md basics/configuration Leaf bundle basics/configuration/index.md basics/configuration Page basics/configuration.md basics/configuration If you’ve linked from a page of one language to a page of another language, conversion is a bit more difficult but Hugo got you covered as well.\nAlso, the old themes implementation allowed refs to non-existing content. This will cause Hugos implementation to show the error below and abort the generation. If your project relies on this old behavior, you can reconfigure the error handling of Hugos implementation.\nIn the best case your usage of the old implementation is already standard compliant and you don’t need to change anything. You’ll notice this very easily once you’ve started hugo server after an upgrade and no errors are written to the console.\nYou may see errors on the console after the update in the form:\nERROR 2021/11/19 22:29:10 [en] REF_NOT_FOUND: Ref \"basics/configuration/_index.md\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\\exampleSite\\content\\_index.en.md:19:22\": page not found In this case, you must apply one of two options:\nCopy the old implementation files theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/ref.html and theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/relref.html to your own projects layouts/shortcode/ref.html and layouts/shortcode/relref.html respectively. This is not recommended as your project will still rely on non-standard behavior afterwards.\nStart up a text editor with regular expression support for search and replace. Apply the following conversions in the given order on all *.md files. This is the recommended choice.\nType Search Replace by Branch bundle (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*)/_index\\.md\" $1\" Leaf bundle (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*)/index\\.md\" $1\" Page (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*)\\.md\" $1\" 2.8.0 (2021-11-03) Change Although never officially documented, this release removes the font Novacento/Novecento. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with Work Sans. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for Czech.\nNew The theme now supports favicons served from static/images/ named as favicon or logo in SVG, PNG or ICO format out of the box. An overridden partial layouts/partials/favicon.html may not be necessary anymore in most cases.\nNew You can hide the table of contents menu for the whole site by setting the disableToc option in your config.toml. For an example see the example configuration.\n2.7.0 (2021-10-24) New Optional second parameter for notice shortcode to set title in box header. 2.6.0 (2021-10-21) New Your site can now be served from a subfolder if you set baseURL and canonifyURLs=true in your config.toml. See the documentation for a detailed example. 2.5.0 (2021-10-08) Change New colors --CODE-BLOCK-color and --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color were added to provide a fallback for Hugos syntax highlighting in case guessSyntax=true is set. Ideally the colors are set to the same values as the ones from your chosen chroma style. 2.4.0 (2021-10-07) Change Creation of customized stylesheets was simplified down to only contain the CSS variables. Everything else can and should be deleted from your custom stylesheet to assure everything works fine. For the predefined stylesheet variants, this change is already included.\nNew Hidden pages are displayed by default in their according tags page. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableTagHiddenPages=true in your config.toml.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus for the whole site by setting the alwaysopen option in your config.toml. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New frontmatter ordersectionsby option to change immediate children sorting in menu and children shortcode. Possible values are title or weight.\nNew Alternate content of a page is now advertised in the HTML meta tags. See Hugo documentation.\n2.3.0 (2021-09-13) 0.81.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nNew Showcase multilanguage features by providing a documentation translation “fer us pirrrates”. There will be no other translations besides the original English one and the Pirates one due to maintenance constraints.\n2.2.0 (2021-09-09) New Hidden pages are displayed by default in the sitemap generated by Hugo and are therefore visible for search engine indexing. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSeoHiddenPages=true in your config.toml. 2.1.0 (2021-09-07) 0.69.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange In case the site’s structure contains additional *.md files not part of the site (eg files that are meant to be included by site pages - see CHANGELOG.md in the exampleSite), they will now be ignored by the search.\nNew Hidden pages are indexed for the site search by default. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSearchHiddenPages=true in your config.toml.\nNew If a search term is found in an expand shortcode, the expand will be opened.\nNew The menu will scroll the active item into view on load.\n2.0.0 (2021-08-28) Change Syntax highlighting was switched to the built in Hugo mechanism. You may need to configure a new stylesheet or decide to roll you own as described on in the Hugo documentation\nChange In the predefined stylesheets there was a typo and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVERED-color must be changed to --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange --MENU-HOME-LINK-color and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color were missing in the documentation. You should add them to your custom stylesheets if you want to override the defaults.\nChange Arrow navigation and children shortcode were ignoring setting for ordersectionsby. This is now changed and may result in different sorting order of your sub pages.\nChange If hidden pages are accessed directly by typing their URL, they will be exposed in the menu.\nChange A page without a title will be treated as hidden=true.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus in the frontmatter. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New partials for defining pre/post content for menu items and the content. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Shortcode children with new parameter containerstyle.\nNew New shortcode include to include arbitrary file content into a page.\n1.2.0 (2021-07-26) New Shortcode expand with new parameter to open on page load. 1.1.0 (2021-07-02) Breaking Mermaid diagrams can now be panned and zoomed. This isn’t configurable yet.\nNew Mermaid config options can be set in config.toml.\n1.0.0 (2021-07-01) 0.65.0 The requirement for the Hugo version of this theme is the same as for the Learn theme version 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01.\nNew Initial fork of the Learn theme based on Learn 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01. This introduces no new features besides a global rename to Relearn and a new logo. For the reasons behind forking the Learn theme, see this comment in the Learn issues.\n",

    "content": "Let’s face it: Writing content for the web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid HTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. John Gruber\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nTip Bookmark this page and the official Commonmark reference for easy future reference!\nParagraphs In Markdown your content usually spans the whole available document width. This is called a block. Blocks are always separated by whitespace to their adjacent blocks in the resulting document.\nAny text not starting with a special sign is written as normal, plain text paragraph block and must be separated to its adjacent blocks by empty lines.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nHeadings A good idea is to structure your content using headings and subheadings. HTML-headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level.\nIn Hugo you usually don’t use h1 as this is generated by your theme and you should only have one such element in a document.\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Result h1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading Horizontal Rules To further structure your content you can add horizontal rules. They create a “thematic break” between paragraph blocks. In Markdown, you can create it with three consecutive dashes ---.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. --- Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nText Markers Bold You can show importance of a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight by enclosing it with two asterisks **.\nI am rendered with **bold text** Result I am rendered with bold text\nItalics You can emphasize a snippet of text with italics by enclosing it with underscores _.\nI am rendered with _italicized text_ Result I am rendered with italicized text\nStrikethrough In GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) you can do strikethroughs by enclosing text with two tildes ~~.\n~~Strike through this text~~ Result Strike through this text\nText substitution This Markdown dialect supports an extension to combine multiple punctuation characters to single typographic entities. This will only be applied to text outside of code blocks or inline code.\nDouble quotes `\"` and single quotes `'` of enclosed text are replaced by **\"double curly quotes\"** and **'single curly quotes'**. Double dashes `--` and triple dashes `---` are replaced by en-dash **--** and em-dash **---** entities. Double arrows pointing left `\u003c\u003c` or right `\u003e\u003e` are replaced by arrow **\u003c\u003c** and **\u003e\u003e** entities. Three consecutive dots `...` are replaced by an ellipsis **...** entity. Result Double quotes \" and single quotes ' of enclosed text are replaced by “double curly quotes” and ‘single curly quotes’.\nDouble dashes -- and triple dashes --- are replaced by en-dash – and em-dash — entities.\nDouble arrows pointing left \u003c\u003c or right \u003e\u003e are replaced by arrow « and » entities.\nThree consecutive dots ... are replaced by an ellipsis … entity.\nLists Unordered You can write a list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.\nIt is possible to nest lists by indenting an item for the next sublevel.\nYou may use any of -, * or + to denote bullets for each list item but should not switch between those symbols inside one whole list.\n- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet - Consectetur adipiscing elit - Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem - Ac tristique libero volutpat at - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit - Phasellus iaculis neque - Purus sodales ultricies - Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem Ac tristique libero volutpat at Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Phasellus iaculis neque Purus sodales ultricies Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Ordered You can create a list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.\nIt is possible to nest lists by indenting an item for the next sublevel.\nMarkdown will automatically number each of your items consecutively. This means, the order number you are providing is irrelevant.\n1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 3. Consectetur adipiscing elit 1. Integer molestie lorem at massa 7. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet 99. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit 1. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 1. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 17.

Definition lists are made of terms and definitions of these terms, much like in a dictionary.\nA definition list in Markdown Extra is made of a single-line term followed by a colon and the definition for that term. You can also associate more than one term to a definition.\nIf you add empty lines around the definition terms, additional vertical space will be generated. Also multiple paragraphs are possible\nApple : Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae. : An American computer company. Orange : The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus. You can make juice out of it. : A telecommunication company. You can't make juice out of it. Result Apple Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae. An American computer company. Orange The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus. You can make juice out of it.\nA telecommunication company. You can’t make juice out of it.\nCode Inline Code Inline snippets of code can be wrapped with backticks `.\nIn this example, `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e` is marked as code. Result In this example, \u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e is marked as code.\nIndented Code Block A simple code block can be generated by indenting several lines of code by at least two spaces.\nBe impressed by my advanced code: // Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Result Be impressed by my advanced code:\n// Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Fenced Code Block If you want to gain more control of your code block you can enclose your code by at least three backticks ``` a so called fence.\nIn GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) you can also add a language specifier directly after the opening fence, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied according to the selected language in the rendered HTML.\nSee Code Highlighting for additional documentation.\n```js grunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: 'docs/assets', data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}', helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js', partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}'] }, pages: { options: { layout: 'default.hbs' }, files: { './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs'] } } } }; ``` Result grunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: 'docs/assets', data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}', helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js', partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}'] }, pages: { options: { layout: 'default.hbs' }, files: { './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs'] } } } }; Tables In GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) you can create tables by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. | | ext | extension to be used for dest files. | Result Option Description data path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. engine engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. ext extension to be used for dest files. Aligned Columns Adding a colon on the left and/or right side of the dashes below any heading will align the text for that column accordingly.\n| Option | Number | Description | | ------:|:------:|:----------- | | data | 1 | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | 2 | engine to be used for processing templates.

Handlebars is the default. ext 3 extension to be used for dest files. Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document add \u003e before any text you want to quote.\nBlockquotes can also be nested.\n\u003e Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue.

Vestibulum aliquet sollicitudin erat, ut aliquet purus posuere luctus.\nLinks Autolink In GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) absolute URLs will automatically be converted into a link.\nThis is a link to https://example.com. Result This is a link to https://example.com.\nBasic Link You can explicitly define links in case you want to use non-absolute URLs or want to give different text.\n[Assemble](http://assemble.io) Result Assemble\nLink with Tooltip For even further information, you can add an additional text, displayed in a tooltip on hovering over the link.\n[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ \"Visit Upstage!\") Result Upstage\nLink References Links can be simplyfied for recurring reuse by using a reference ID to later define the URL location. This simplyfies writing if you want to use a link more than once in a document.\n[Example][somelinkID] [somelinkID]: https://example.com \"Go to example domain\" Result Example\nFootnotes Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things, a marker in the text that will become a superscript number and a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes.\nUsually the list of footnotes will be shown at the end of your document. If we use a footnote in a notice box it will instead be listed at the end of its box.\nFootnotes can contain block elements, which means that you can put multiple paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and so on in a footnote. It works the same as for list items, just indent the following paragraphs by four spaces in the footnote definition.\nThat's some text with a footnote[^1] [^1]: And that's the footnote. That's some more text with a footnote.[^someid] [^someid]: Anything of interest goes here. Blue light glows blue. Result That’s some text with a footnote1\nThat’s some more text with a footnote.2\nAnd that’s the footnote. ↩︎\nAnything of interest goes here.\nBlue light glows blue. ↩︎\nImages Basic Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation mark.\n![Spock](https://octodex.github.com/images/spocktocat.png) Result Image with Tooltip Like links, images can also be given a tooltip.\n![Picard](https://octodex.github.com/images/jean-luc-picat.jpg \"Jean Luc Picard\") Result Image References Images can also be linked by reference ID to later define the URL location. This simplyfies writing if you want to use an image more than once in a document.\n![La Forge][laforge] [laforge]: https://octodex.github.com/images/trekkie.jpg \"Geordi La Forge\" Result Further Image Formatting This theme allows additional non-standard formatting by setting query parameter at the end of the image URL.\nResizing Add query parameter width and/or height to the link image to resize the image. Values are CSS values (default is auto).\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?width=20vw) Result ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px) Result ![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?height=50px\u0026width=40vw) Result CSS Classes Add a query parameter classes to the link image to add CSS classes.

Full support for languages written right to left Automatic menu generation from multilingual content In-browser language switching Basic configuration After learning how Hugo handle multilingual websites, define your languages in your config.toml file.\nFor example with current English and Piratized English website.\nNote Make sure your default language is defined as the first one in the [Languages] array, as the theme needs to make assumptions on it\n# English is the default language defaultContentLanguage = \"en\" [Languages] [Languages.en] title = \"Hugo Relearn Theme\" weight = 1 languageName = \"English\" [Languages.pir] title = \"Cap'n Hugo Relearrrn Theme\" weight = 2 languageName = \"Arrr! Pirrrates\" Then, for each new page, append the id of the language to the file.\nSingle file my-page.md is split in two files: in English: my-page.md in Piratized English: my-page.pir.md Single file _index.md is split in two files: in English: _index.md in Piratized English: _index.pir.md Info Be aware that only translated pages are displayed in menu. It’s not replaced with default language content.\nTip Use slug frontmatter parameter to translate urls too.\nSearch In case each page’s content is written in one single language only, the above configuration will already configure the site’s search functionality correctly.\nWarning Although the theme supports a wide variety of supported languages, the site’s search via the Lunr search library does not. You’ll see error reports in your browsers console log for each unsupported language. Currently unsupported are:\nCzech Indonesian Polish Search with mixed language support In case your page’s content contains text in multiple languages (e.g. you are writing a Russian documentation for your english API), you can add those languages to your config.toml to broaden search.\n[params] additionalContentLanguage = [ \"en\" ] As this is an array, you can add multiple additional languages.\nNote Keep in mind that the language code required here, is the base language code. E.g. if you have additional content in zh-CN, you have to add just zh to this parameter.\nOverwrite translation strings Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (Edit button, Search placeholder and so on). Translations are available in English and Piratized English but you may use another language or want to override default values.\nTo override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder i18n/\u003cidlanguage\u003e.toml and inspire yourself from the theme themes/hugo-theme-relearn/i18n/en.toml\nDisable language switching Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.\nJust set disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true in your config.toml\n[params] # When using multilingual website, disable the switch language button. disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true ",

If you don’t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you learn more about it by following this great documentation for beginners.\nCreate your project Hugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u003cnew_project\u003e Install the theme Install the Relearn theme by following this documentation using Hugo’s module system.\nThis theme’s repository is: https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git\nAlternatively, you can download the theme as .zip file and extract it in the themes directory\nFrom Git If you install the theme from your git repository or GitHub, you have several options.\nIf you use the head of the main branch, you are using the development version. Usually it is fully functional but can break from time to time. We try to fix newly introduced bugs in this version as soon as possible.\nAdditionally you can checkout one of the tagged versions. These tagged versions correspond to an official releases from the GitHub repository.\nBesides the usual version tags (eg 1.2.3) there are also tags for the main version (eg. 1.2.x), major version (eg. 1.x) and the latest (just x) released version making it easier for you to pin the theme to a certain version.\nBasic configuration When building the website, you can set a theme by using --theme option. However, we suggest you modify the configuration file (config.toml) and set the theme as the default. You can also add the [outputs] section to enable the search functionality.\n# Change the default theme to be use when building the site with Hugo theme = \"hugo-theme-relearn\" # For search functionality [outputs] home = [ \"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"SEARCH\"] Create your first chapter page Chapters are pages that contain other child pages. It has a special layout style and usually just contains a chapter name, the title and a brief abstract of the section.\n### Chapter 1 # Basics Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core concepts behind it. renders as\nThe Relearn theme provides archetypes to create skeletons for your website. Begin by creating your first chapter page with the following command\nhugo new --kind chapter basics/_index.md By opening the given file, you should see the property chapter=true on top, meaning this page is a chapter.\nBy default all chapters and pages are created as a draft. If you want to render these pages, remove the property draft: true from the metadata.\nCreate your first content pages Then, create content pages inside the previously created chapter. Here are two ways to create content in the chapter:\nhugo new basics/first-content.md hugo new basics/second-content/_index.md Feel free to edit those files by adding some sample content and replacing the title value in the beginning of the files.\nLaunching the website locally Launch by using the following command:\nhugo serve Go to http://localhost:1313\nYou should notice three things:\nYou have a left-side Basics menu, containing two submenus with names equal to the title properties in the previously created files. The home page explains how to customize it by following the instructions. When you run hugo serve, when the contents of the files change, the page automatically refreshes with the changes. Neat! Build the website When your site is ready to deploy, run the following command:\nhugo A public folder will be generated, containing all static content and assets for your website. It can now be deployed on any web server.\nNote This website can be automatically published and hosted with Netlify (Read more about Automated HUGO deployments with Netlify). Alternatively, you can use GitHub pages.\n",

See https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5226.\nServing your page from the filesystem If you want your page served from the filesystem by using URLs starting with file:// you’ll need the following configuration in your config.toml:\nrelativeURLs = true The theme will append an additional index.html to all branch bundle links by default to make the page be servable from the file system. If you don’t care about the file system and only serve your page via a webserver you can also generate the links without this change by adding this to your config.toml\n[params] disableExplicitIndexURLs = true Note If you want to use the search feature from the file system using an older installation of the theme make sure to change your outputformat for the homepage from the now deprecated JSON to SEARCH as seen below.\nActivate search If not already present, add the following lines in the same config.toml file.\n[outputs] home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"SEARCH\"] This will generate a search index file at the root of your public folder ready to be consumed by the Lunr search library. Note that the SEARCH outputformat was named JSON in previous releases but was implemented differently. Although JSON still works, it is now deprecated.\nActivate dedicated search page You can add a dedicated search page for your page by adding the SEARCHPAGE outputformat to your home page by adding the following lines in your config.toml file.\n[outputs] home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"SEARCH\", \"SEARCHPAGE\"] You can access this page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or by typing some search term and pressing ENTER inside of the menu’s search box .\nActivate print support You can activate print support to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site. Just add the PRINT output format to your home, section and page in your config.toml as seen below:\n[outputs] home = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"PRINT\", \"SEARCH\"] section = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"PRINT\"] page = [\"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"PRINT\"] This will add a little printer icon in the top bar. It will switch the page to print preview when clicked. You can then send this page to the printer by using your browser’s usual print functionality.\nNote The resulting URL will not be configured ugly in terms of Hugo’s URL handling even if you’ve set uglyURLs=true in your config.toml. This is due to the fact that for one mime type only one suffix can be configured.\nNevertheless, if you’re unhappy with the resulting URLs you can manually redefine outputFormats.PRINT in your own config.toml to your liking.\nMathJax The MathJax configuration parameters can also be set on a specific page. In this case, the global parameter would be overwritten by the local one. See Math for additional documentation.\nExample MathJax is globally disabled. By default it won’t be loaded by any page.\nOn page “Physics” you coded some JavaScript for a dynamic formulae. You can set the MathJax parameters locally to load mathJax on this page.\nYou also can disable MathJax for specific pages while globally enabled.\nMermaid The Mermaid configuration parameters can also be set on a specific page. In this case, the global parameter would be overwritten by the local one. See Mermaid for additional documentation.\nExample Mermaid is globally disabled. By default it won’t be loaded by any page.\nOn page “Architecture” you coded some JavaScript to dynamically generate a class diagram. You can set the Mermaid parameters locally to load mermaid on this page.\nYou also can disable Mermaid for specific pages while globally enabled.\nHome Button Configuration If the disableLandingPageButton option is set to false, a Home button will appear on the left menu. It is an alternative for clicking on the logo. To edit the appearance, you will have to configure two parameters for the defined languages:\n[Languages] [Languages.en] ... landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" ... [Languages.pir] ... landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Arrr! Homme\" ... If those params are not configured for a specific language, they will get their default values:\nlandingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" The home button is going to look like this:\n",

If you need to overwrite something, don’t change the code directly. Instead follow this page. You’d create a new partial in the layouts/partials folder of your local project. This partial will have the priority.\nThis theme defines the following partials :\nheader.html: the header of the page. See output-formats footer.html: the footer of the page. See output-formats body.html: the body of the page. The body may contain of one or many articles. See output-formats article.html: the output for a single article, can contain elements around your content. See output-formats menu.html: left menu. Not meant to be overwritten search.html: search box. Not meant to be overwritten custom-header.html: custom headers in page. Meant to be overwritten when adding CSS imports. Don’t forget to include style HTML tag directive in your file. custom-footer.html: custom footer in page. Meant to be overwritten when adding JavaScript. Don’t forget to include javascript HTML tag directive in your file. favicon.html: the favicon heading-pre.html: side-wide configuration to prepend to pages title headings. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s headingPre setting into account. heading-post.html: side-wide configuration to append to pages title headings. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s headingPost setting into account. logo.html: the logo, on top left hand corner meta.html: HTML meta tags, if you want to change default behavior menu-pre.html: side-wide configuration to prepend to menu items. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s menuPre setting into account. menu-post.html: side-wide configuration to append to menu items. If you override this, it is your responsibility to take the page’s menuPost setting into account. menu-footer.html: footer of the the left menu toc.html: table of contents content.html: the content page itself. This can be overridden if you want to display page’s meta data above or below the content. content-footer: footer below the content, has a default implementation but you can overwrite it if you don’t like it. Change the logo Create a new file in layouts/partials/ named logo.html. Then write any HTML you want. You could use an img HTML tag and reference an image created under the static folder, or you could paste a SVG definition!\nNote The size of the logo will adapt automatically\nChange the favicon If your favicon is a SVG, PNG or ICO, just drop off your image in your local static/images/ folder and name it favicon.svg, favicon.png or favicon.ico respectively.\nIf no favicon file is found, the theme will lookup the alternative filename logo in the same location and will repeat the search for the list of supported file types.\nIf you need to change this default behavior, create a new file in layouts/partials/ named favicon.html. Then write something like this:\n\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/images/favicon.bmp\" type=\"image/bmp\"\u003e Change the colors The Relearn theme lets you choose between some predefined color variants in light or dark mode, but feel free to add one yourself!\nYou can preview the shipped variants by changing them in the variant selector at the bottom of the menu.\nSingle variant Set the themeVariant value with the name of your theme file. That’s it!\n[params] themeVariant = \"relearn-light\" In the above example your theme file has to be named theme-relearn-light.css\nMultiple variants You can also set multiple variants. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant switch will be shown in the menu footer.\n[params] # Change default color scheme with a variant one. themeVariant = [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] Tip If you want to switch the syntax highlighting theme together with your color variant, generate a syntax highlighting stylesheet and configure your installation according to Hugo’s documentation, and @import this stylesheet in your color variant stylesheet. For an example, take a look into theme-relearn-light.css and config.toml of the exampleSite.\nAdjust to OS Settings You can also cause the site to adjust to your OS settings for light/dark mode. Just set the themeVariant to auto. That’s it.\nIf you’ve set multiple variants, you can drop auto at any position, but usually it makes sense to set it in the first position and make it the default.\n[params] themeVariant = [ \"auto\", \"red\" ] If you don’t configure anything else, the theme will use relearn-light for light mode and relearn-dark for dark mode.\nIf you don’t like that, you can set themeVariantAuto. The first element is the variant for light mode, the second for dark mode\n[params] themeVariantAuto = [ \"learn\", \"neon\" ] Note This is not supported for Internet Explorer 11, which still displays in the relearn-light variant.\nRoll your own If you are not happy with the shipped variants you can either copy and rename one of the shipped files from themes/hugo-theme-relearn/static/css to static/css, edit them afterwards to your liking in a text editor and configure the themeVariant parameter in your config.toml or just use the interactive variant generator.\nOutput formats Certain parts of the theme can be changed for support of your own output formats. Eg. if you define a new output format PLAINTEXT in your config.toml, you can add a file layouts/partials/header.plaintext.html to change the way, the page header should look like for that output format.\n",

The graph and the page will update accordingly.\nThe arrowed lines reflect how colors are inherited thru different parts of the theme if the descendent isn’t overwritten. If you want to delete a color and let it inherit from its parent, just delete the value from the input field.\nTo better understand this select the neon variant and modify the different heading colors. There, colors for the heading h2, h3 and h4 are explicitly set. h5 is not set and inherits its value from h4. h6 is also not set and inherits its value from h5.\nOnce you’ve changed a color, the variant switch will show a “My custom variant” entry and your changes are stored in the browser. You can browse to other pages and even close the browser without losing your changes.\nOnce you are satisfied, you can download the new variants file and copy it into your site’s static/css directory.

    "content": "Semver This project tries to follow the semver policy - although not followed 100% in the past.\nUsually an entry of Breaking on the What’s new page causes a new major release number.\nAll other entries on the What’s new page will increase the minor release number.\nReleases resulting in a new major or minor number are called main release.\nReleases containing bugixes only, are only increasing the patch release number. Those releases don’t result in announcements on the What’s new page.\nEntries on the What’s new page are checked and enforced during the version-release GitHub Action.\nManaging Issues Issues are categorized and managed by assigning labels to it.\nOnce working on an issue, assign it to a fitting maintainer.\nWhen done, close the ticket. Once an issue is closed, it needs to be assigned to next release milestone.\nA once released ticket is not allowed to be reopened and rereleased in a different milestone. This would cause the changelog to be changed even for the milestone the issue was previously released in. Instead write a new ticket.\nManaging Pull Requests If a PR is merged and closed it needs an accompanied issue assigned to. If there is no issue for a PR, the maintainer needs to create one.\nYou can assign multiple PRs to one issue as long as they belong together.\nUsually set the same labels and milestone for the PR as for the accompanied issue.\nLabels Kind An issue that results in changesets must have exactly one of the following labels. This needs to be assigned latest before release.\nLabel Description Changelog section documentation Improvements or additions to documentation - discussion This issue was converted to a discussion - task Maintainence work Maintenance feature New feature or request Features bug Something isn’t working Fixes Impact If the issue would cause a new main release due to semver semantics it needs one of the according labels and the matching badge on the What’s new page.\nLabel Description change Introduces changes with existing installations breaking Introduces breaking changes with existing installations Declination If an issue does not result in changesets but is closed anyways, it must have exactly one of the following labels.\nLabel Description duplicate This issue or pull request already exists invalid This doesn’t seem right unresolved No progress on this issue update A documented change in behaviour wontfix This will not be worked on Halt You can assign one further label out of the following list to signal readers that development on an open issue is currently halted for different reasons.\nLabel Description blocked Depends on other issue to be fixed first idea A valuable idea that’s currently not worked on undecided No decission was made yet helpwanted Great idea, send in a PR needsfeedback Further information is needed 3rd-Party If the issue is not caused by a programming error in the themes own code, you can label the causing program or library.\nLabel Description browser This is a topic related to the browser but not the theme device This is a topic related to a certain device hugo This is a topic related to Hugo itself but not the theme mermaid This is a topic related to Mermaid itself but not the theme Making Releases A release is based on a milestone named like the release itself - just the version number, eg: 1.2.3. It’s in the maintainers responsiblity to check semver semantics of the milestone’s name prior to release and change it if necessary.\nMaking releases is automated by the version-release GitHub Action. It requires the version number of the milestone that should be released. The release will be created from the main branch of the repository.\nTreat released milestones as immutable. Don’t rerelease an already released milestone. An already released milestone may already been consumed by your users.\nDuring execution of the action a few things are checked. If a check fails the action fails, resulting in no new release. You can correct the errors afterwards and rerun the action.\nThe following checks will be enforced\nthe milestone exists there is at least one closed issue assigned to the milestone all assigned issues for this milestone are closed if it’s a main release, there must be a new \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e at the beginning of the What’s new page if it’s a patch release, there must be the \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e from the previous release at the beginning of the What’s new page After a successful run of the action\nthe History page is updated, including release version, release date and text the What’s new page is updated, including release version, release date and text the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated the updated files are commited the milestone is closed the repository is tagged with the version number (eg. 1.2.3), the main version number (eg. 1.2.x) and the major version number (eg. 1.x) a new entry in the GitHub release list with the according changelog will be created the official documentation is built and deployed the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated to a temporary and commited (this helps to determine if users are running directly on the main branch or are using releases) a new milestone for the next patch release is created (this can later be renamed to a main release if necessary) ",
